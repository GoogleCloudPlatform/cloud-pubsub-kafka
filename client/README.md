The alpha client libraries in this directory have been replaced by the official
[Google Cloud Pub/Sub Java client library](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-java/tree/master/google-cloud-pubsub).
The semantics and performance improvements introduced in these alpha libraries
have been preserved and improved in the official libraries, so we strongly
encourage you to migrate. However, we have no plan to remove this code from our [Maven
repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.google.pubsub%22).
