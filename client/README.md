### Introduction

High Performance Cloud Pub/Sub Client libraries.

(NOTE) This client includes only data plane operations, publishing and
pulling messages, and is based on the 
[Pub/Sub gRPC alpha API](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/grpc-overview).  

(EXPERIMENTAL) This library uses features that are part of an invitation-only
release of the underlying Cloud Pub/Sub API. The library will generate
errors unless you have access to this API. This restriction should be
relaxed in the near future. Please contact cloud-pubsub@google.com with any
questions in the meantime.
