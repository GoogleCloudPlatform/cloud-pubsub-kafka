### Introduction

This load test framework, known as Flic (Framework of
load & integration for Cloud Pub/Sub), for Cloud Pub/Sub
is a tool targeted for developers
and companies who use [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org).
The goal of this framework is twofold:

1.  Provide users with a tool that allows them to see how Cloud Pub/Sub performs
    under various conditions.

2.  Provide a tool for integration testing the CloudPubSubConnector (link it),
    where the purpose is to show that the CloudPubSubConnector works and is a
    viable tool that can transfer your messages from Kafka to Cloud Pub/Sub and
    vice versa.

### Building

These instructions assume you are using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

1.  Clone the repository, ensuring to do so recursively to pick up submodules:

    `git clone --recursive ADD LINK ONCE REPO LOCATION IS DETERMINED`

2.  Make the jar that contains the connector:

    `mvn package`

3. Copy the jar into the GCE resource directory:

    `cp target/driver.jar target/gce/`

The resulting jar is at target/driver.jar.

### Pre-Running Steps

1.  Regardless of whether you are running on Google Cloud Platform or not, you
    need to create a project and create a service key that allows you access to
    the Cloud Pub/Sub API's and default quotas.

2.  Create project on Google Cloud Platform. By default, this project will have
    multiple service accounts associated with it (see "IAM & Admin" within GCP
    console). Within this section, find the tab for "Service Accounts". Create a
    new service account and make sure to select "Furnish a new private key".
    Doing this will create the service account and download a private key file
    to your local machine.

3.  Go to the "IAM" tab, find the service account you just created and click on
    the dropdown menu named "Role(s)". Under the "Pub/Sub" submenu, select
    "Pub/Sub Admin".

    If you don't see the service account in the list, add a new permission, use
    the service account as the member name, and select "Pub/Sub Admin" from the
    role dropdown menu in the window.

    Now, the service account you just created should appear in the members list
    on the IAM page with the role Pub/Sub Admin. If the member name is gray,
    don't worry. It will take a few minutes for the account's new permissions to
    make their way through the system.

    Finally, the key file that was downloaded to your machine
    needs to be placed on the machine running the framework. An environment
    variable named GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS must point to this file. (Tip:
    export this environment variable as part of your shell startup file).

    `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key/file`

### Important Notes

There are important differences in the clients used for Cloud Pub/Sub and Kafka
in this framework. For Cloud Pub/Sub, we implemented a reasonably optimized
client with parallelization of requests across multiple threads, asynchronous
callback threads to increase client throughput, batching, and rate limitation.
For Kafka, we used the Producer API released by Apache, which includes some of
those same features or rate limits, batching, and asynchronous callback threads,
but of course they're implemented slightly differently to better integrate with
Kafka brokers.

Currently, the number of threads, batch size, etc. is customizable in this
framework with the CPS client, but not yet customizable with the Kafka API. We
are working on getting this as close to a 1:1 to comparison as possible, but the
load generated by the different clients could differ slightly as is. The
difference shouldn't be large, but we advise you to take care to look at the
QPS numbers in detail before drawing significant conclusions.

However, we took care to make sure the data recording was as similar as
possible. Both clients measure total latency as the time a message is added to a
batch to be sent until its callback method is called. Although exactly what load
the service sees might differ slightly, the record of how it responds, its
latency and throughput, are equivalent.

### Quickstart

1.  The jar file can be executed with numerous commands and options specified
    from the command line. In a single invocation, the framework allows you to
    use Kafka or Cloud Pub/Sub as the message service, and to publish or consume
    messages from this service. The following command runs a load test for Cloud
    Pub/Sub using the provided script run.py. Make sure to fill in the required
    field in the script before execution. For example, you must replace '[YOUR
    TOPIC HERE]' with an existing topic.

    `python -c 'import run; run.cps_pub_load_test()'`

2.  To get a list of all available commands, options and defaults, run the
    following.

    `./run.py --help`

### Load Testing Component

1.  Imagine you wanted to run a small and simple load test that published
    messages to Cloud Pub/Sub. Below is an example of an invocation of the
    framework that would do this:

    `./run.py --num_messages=1000 --topics=mytopic cps --project=myproject`

2.  The output for this test would look something like this:

    `INFO - Creating a task which publishes to CPS.`

    `INFO - Progress:Asynchronously processed 100 messages`

    `INFO - Progress: Asynchronously processed 1000 messages`

    `INFO - Pub-to-Ack for 1000 messages: (min, max, avg, 50%, 95%, 99%) =
    [STATS HERE]`

    `INFO - Average Throughput: [STATS HERE]`

    `INFO - Done!`

3.  Now imagine you want to run a much more involved load test where you use
    different command line arguments to alter how the Cloud Pub/Sub performace.
    For example, let us say you want to publish 1 million messages of size 1 KB
    and you want the messages to be sent in batches of 1000. Also, you would
    like for there to be 5 round robin clients and 3 threads in the callback
    thread pool. Finally, you would like there to be a limit of 100 requests per
    second. The following command does this for you:

    `./run.py --num_messages=1000 --message_size=1024 --topics=mytopic cps
    --project=myproject --batch_size=1000 --num_clients=5 --response_threads=3
    --rate_limit=100`

4.  For our last example, imagine you want to both publish and consume messages
    from Cloud Pub/Sub. One feature of the Cloud Pub/Sub client code which
    consumes messages is that it indicates to you when to start publishing. This
    is necessary because the subscriptions need to be made before messages start
    flowing into a topic. The steps below show how to run this test:

    `./run.py --publish false --num_messages=1000
    --topics=mytopic:mysubscription cps --project=myproject
    (Run this in a different shell)`.

    `./run.py --num_messages=1000 --topics=mytopic cps --project=myproject`.

    Note: Running the subscription script will create a new subscription to your
    pubsub topic, there is no need to create one before running. In fact, we
    advise against using an already-existing subscription. The load test
    requires a fresh subscription to avoid un-delivered messages published
    before the test began counting to the latency numbers (because they could be
    days old!). To avoid this, upon encountering a subscription that already
    exists, the framework will delete it and recreate one with the same name.

5.  The output for this test would look something like this: (We omit the output
    from the publisher, see step #2 for how that looks).

    `INFO - Creating a task which consumes from CPS`

    `INFO - Start publishing...`

    `INFO - Progress: Asynchronously processed 100 messages`

    `INFO - Progress: Asynchronously processed 1000 messages`

    `INFO - End-to-End for 1000 messages: (min, max, avg, 50%, 95%, 99%) =
    [STATS HERE]`

    `INFO - Average Throughput: [STATS HERE]`

    `INFO - Done!`

### Integration Component

It is easy to test out the CloudPubSubConnector and explore its functionality by
creating some simple "integration" tests. The following steps would perform a
simple integration test for the sink connector.

1.  Create a topic on Kafka. Run two invocations of the framework, one that
    consumes messages from Kafka and one that publishes. Be sure to turn on data
    dumps (This dumps consumed message data into a directory "data").

    `./run.py --publish false --dump_data --topics=mytopic kafka
    --broker=localhost:9092`

    `./run.py --topics=mytopic kafka --broker=localhost:9092`

2.  Once those two are complete, create a topic on Cloud Pub/Sub and run an
    invocation of the framewok that consumes from CPS. Turn data dumps on here
    also. Once you get the "Start publishing" signal. start the connector
    (Ensure your connector is properly configured) `

    `./run.py --publish false --dump_data --topics=mytopic cps
    --project=myproject`

3.  Use the "compare" command to verify that the consumed messages match. The
    data which you dumped previously will be sitting in data/CPS and data/KAFKA.

    `./run.py compare --file1=CPS --file2=KAFKA`

Similar steps can be taken to perform an integration test for the source
connector.

### Common Errors

1.  If an invocation of the framework publishes or consumes from Kafka, but you
    do not have a Kafka cluster running, you will see the following error:

    `Failed to update metadata after (some amount) ms.`

2.  Similarly, if an invocation of the framework publishes or consumes from
    Cloud Pub/Sub but you do not have a Google Cloud Platform project or the
    topic you specified does not exist, you will see the following error:

    `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`

3.  If you failed to properly set up a service account key and point the
    appropriate environment variable to the key file, you will get an error that
    looks like the following:

    `Request had insufficient authentication scopes`

4.  There are times when gRPC (the RPC framework that powers the Cloud Pub Sub
    client code), runs out of memory. You will see the following error(s) if
    this happens:

    `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory`
    `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:
    GC overhead limit reached`

    To fix this, simply give the JVM more memory to work with.
